- Post Title: Please help me obtain Bullet Witch assets

On the 25th of April, Bullet Witch just got re-released on Steam and since I REALLY like this game and I've recently started learning how to use Unreal Engine 4 to do stuff, I'd like to try importing the game's assets into this vastly superior new engine. 
Problem is that since I completely missed the the asset bandwagon back in the day, I now find myself left without a way of getting those assets, for my little project.
I know noesis has a plug-in for extracting them, but I have no idea on HOW to use noesis, I can't seem to find any tutorials to this end and all the links I could find to Bullet Witch asset packs are long since dead and gone.

So I beg of you, does anyone here still happen to either have the game's assets lying about somewhere, or be willing to re-extract them now please?

I would like to get every one of the game's assets but, failing that, just obtain as many of them as I still can.

I never thought anyone would reply after this much time. Thank you for the model of Alicia.

Basicaly, what I want is to remake the entirety of Bullet Witch, inside the unreal engine, as a learning exercise.
What I need is as many of the game's assets (models, textures, maps, etc.) as possible, in order to remake it as closely as can be done and to easy my own workload while doing so. 
The problem is that I only have the steam version, which noesis is not compatible with. Also, I would like to use the steam assets since some of those were enhanced when the game was rereleased.

Thank you again, I really appreciate taking the time to reupload Alicia. Do you have the gunrod by any chance?

You're welcome (I know what it feels to seek models and not getting them), the thing is why don't you simply download the 360 version that's what I did it works like a charm with Noesis, if you don't want to bother extracting files from the Xbox ISO I can give them to you then explain how to export them with Noesis but I don't think I'm gonna extract all of them myself. Is that ok with you ?

Like I said, I wanted to use the steam version both because it's the only version of the game that I own, but also because some of the assets have been reworked and are of higher quality.
I actually did try to find the xbox version, but I wasn't able to. Every avenue turned up nothing but dead links.

My last hope was trying ninja ripper but, for some reason, it dumps all the assets it extracts in the same point in space, so now everything is on top of everything else, making recovery impractical to say the least.

I will do the grunt-work myself, if I had the files and knowledge on using noesis.

Will update you when the files are uploaded, the steam version has to be investigate I'll see what I can do but no guarantee.

Thank you very much. I had pretty much given up hope on this.

Could you, before anything else, please extract the gunrod as well? I'm rigging Alicia as we speak in UE4 and would like to have the gun as well. Just the basic rifle gunrod.

Noesis won't exports its albedo but exports its normal & spec weird since it's ok for the rest of the weapons... Do you still want it anyway ? We talking about the rifle version right ? The shotgun is fine tho if you need something quick.

The rifle is fine. The tutorial I'm following uses a rifle.

The rifle was missing one texture I may have confused you but nevermind I found it hidden else where weird you'll see why when you'll have the files in hand tommorow (I'll upload the whole game during the night, yes I'm going to sleep in a bit) [https://mega.nz/#!2Fsz1bIS!6FitaJx6B81H ... uR96uOVHzQ](https://mega.nz/#!2Fsz1bIS!6FitaJx6B81HjBXI0WcEucYePnl8h8LQHuR96uOVHzQ)

I cannot even begin to thank you enough. I honestly thought I would either have to give up on this or trudge through with ninjaripper. THANK YOU!

Heh, so it isn't a single model, but a series of 5.

Well, goodnight. Sweet dreams!

Yeah even Alicia but I cleaned her up regrouping her meshes by UV groups when necessary, for exemple her face was splitted in two unconfortable parts while they were part of the same UV I merged her face's verts in Maya with a threshold of 0,001 because it screws up with a bigger value due to the object scale. Anyhow I also delete copies of materials in the Hypershade and reasigned the lasting ones to its meshes if possible, that's my method at least I didn't group the rifle since these are parts that are supposed to be animated like Alicia. Don't sweat it I'm happy to land a hand and support this project, see you thanks you too.

So, after messing with the Alicia model and trying to figure out why some of the animations look off, I've found a number of issues with the model. I thought they were just problems with the original model, but now I think they are maybe issues from maya.

Issues I've found so far are as follows:

- original .fbx file can't be used as is. Trying to import it in UE4 only produces a blob, while trying to import it in blender, gives an ".fbx 6100 not supported, must be .fbx 7100 or later" error message. 
- the model is absolutely TINY as is. I have to import it with scale value at 100.
- bone 002 (pelvis) and bone 004 (first spine bone) aren't connected.
- bone 001 is occupying the same space as bone 000 and isn't connected to anything.
- there's something wrong with her left shoulder, where bones 040 and 041 are either not connected or connected weirdly and it's messing with my attempts to animate the model.
- there are two IK bones (bone 027 and bone 084) that are occupying the same space. IK bone 027 is only connected to bone 026 (hand bone) and nothing else (in the default UE4 model, the corresponding IK bone is connected to the hand at one end and the root bone at the other end). IK bone 084 starts from the same area as bone 000 and ends at bone 026 but it isn't connected to anything at any end.

What about these lines? They make the blender 2.75 wavefront obj importer stop working:
vt  1.#INF00 1.#INF00 0.000000

(replacing by vt 0.0 0.0 0.0
works, where the last 0.0 is superfluous btw)

Wait I just realized the files I gave were not the "fixed" version mine got rid of the rig since modifying topology unskin the model, try this one instead. (attached file)

They might but I doubt it here´s the model in two different formats straight out of Noesis I can´t do much about it but tell me if it fixes anything if not you´ll have to redo the rig and for that I recommand cleaning first like I did.

Nice! Do the textures from the original file still work with this?

I see the scale is still tiny. Had to bump the scale up to 17.
Since the original file wasn't your reworked one, I take it all the skeleton issues I had were from the original rig used in game?

Hmm... simply applying the textures on the model doesn't seem to work. Guess I'll have to look into this online.

Edit: Scratch that. UE4 flips textures upside down for some reason.

I would think so Noesis doesn´t export a generic skeleton since it works per game case but maybe the scripts for it is a bit jaggy and needs to be fine tuned some more however wait no more I´m uploading the game files about the main character only and her weapons including dlcs so you can have fun in Noesis (roughly in 20 minutes) while the full game upload is to be finished in hours...

In Noesis browse for the location you extracted this open any PWs, WAs or WGs folders models are in "model" folder each time then go to File, Export (Not export from preview) from there choose output format for textures and geometry, change output location if you so desire and you´re done. I forgot to put the texture of the rifle I talked about yesterday since it is in a folder else where called "shared_texture" compared to other weapons which are fine I´m putting it as an attached file.

I got both file sets.

Thank you! Thank you for everything.
I can't promise anything will actually come of this, but chances of things happening are a lot higher now thanks to you, than they ever could have been otherwise.

So far, I've got the original, unedited, model rigged with UE4's default animations. Gonna' go grab some blender tutorials on how to rig your edited model. After that, I will attempt to extract the maps from the game files.

No worries buddy, in-game already ? Wow that's a good start I remember hating UE4 for not doing what I wanted but it's a very good engine. Best luck on your project hope you're going to get something out of it and learn some, keep me updated if you have a Youtube channel or something so I could keep track if you ever make it public.

Lotta time spent relearning blender. Animations are borked since they've only been retargeted from the base UE4 animations, without any touchups. Gunrod shoots and makes gunsounds.
Next stop, getting the maps in the engine.

Hi, I am also working on a fan project (a website) not specific to Bullet Witch but for a community that really loves this game. Is there any chance you can share the model file again? The MEGA links in the thread are dead, and the attachments only contain some fragments. My idea is to build a simple website where you can view the 3D model, or control it if we can get the bone and animation files. Again this is all fan project not for profit. If you could share the file please send a message or leave a reply. Thank you.

If you are still around, I would like help accessing the cpr files just to mess around with textures. I saw on a steam forum that Noesis can do this but for some reason it won't recognise the files for me, even tho Noesis literally has the plugins that specify bulletwitch-cpr/czr type file.
