Enjoy

I know it could be offtopic but I got 2 question ( I guess you won't take one of them as insult and remove the link   )

1-Why did you share it ? I mean fatduck asked lot of money for his max script ( lot for my personal budget, I don't mean he is-was expansive)

2- What happen to fatduck? Where could I find him ,his blogspot seems forgotten

Thanks for sharing

Hey,

first, thanks for share.

But the importer destroys the model when I load the animations. Use the latest version of Aion and 3ds Max 2013.

So this should work for 3ds max 2015.  Can someone make a video of the whole process? And how do you extract the models/animations/textures out of the game?
And could someone upload some sample files including mesh/anim and textures.? Because I don't wanna download a 30 Gb game and find out that the script won't work. 
Regards,

WOW, seriously, wow.
No wonder so many amazing devs get pissed about stuff like this, I get it, every day I see comments like this I get it, wow.

Allow me to clarity:
1.saw this topic, looked at the game, I'm like , interesting, nice.
2.Googled the game and where to download it legit.
3.got the installer from the official website last night, left it run, went to bed, in the morning went to work as usual, came back home this evening, all was done for me, full download, full install, and fully updated, the whole 31.1GB of data.
4.came back here went in search mode typed AION, and voila, all required info was already posted, ready to be used and feast on.
5.decrypted one pak to zip, extracted zip to folder
6.i downloaded the importer
7.fired up Max2018, and once again EUREKA.

PS.
I did this just to proof how easy was to do if your willing to join in instead of staying on the side, and pointing.
What I did was before I even noticed your post obviously.
BTW, that should have been your reply, not obnoxious and demanding.
Also did it for others to see how easy it was, damn, wow.

PPS: Forgot to mention.
I deleted everything after I was done trying, because I satisfied my curiosity for knowledge and how it all works, because I cant stress this enough, it was that EASY, so now I am happy, are you?

You should have asked your question directly, not spam with extra posts, and was it necessary to quote the whole message?
And if its a game related question, or the process about extraction/import of game assets, that was a long time ago, no longer have any of the files to test myself.
