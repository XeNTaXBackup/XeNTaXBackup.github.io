Here is a max script to import models from both these games (they use the same format  )
This will import geometry and assign materials but i have not figured out how to get texture names yet so that will not auto assign a texture.
Also the bone matrix is weird if anyone can help with that please let me know and ill add support right away.
here is a farc extractor bms [viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5462](http://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?f=10&t=5462)
It also has a bms in here to extract the textures from the txp archives. Enjoy.

It seems that all the textures from VF5 are encrypted!

but all other textures looks fine:

My converter works on all virtua fighter 5 models. I am not sure what your question is but yes you can rip this model yourself with these tools.

they are not invalid you need to use a program that supports those kind of normal maps try the tool from ati the compressonator. [http://developer.amd.com/gpu/compresson ... fault.aspx](http://developer.amd.com/gpu/compressonator/pages/default.aspx)
I do not have any issues with that model i have imported all the models from that game without errors.
Most likely something is different in your language encoding.
copy the max file to notepad then re copy it to a new max script and it should work.

Ah okay thank you for the link to fixing those dds files. I opened the script in notepad and then pasted it into a new max script and saved it. Running that yielded the same error. I'm using Max 2011 would that make a difference? What version was your script designed for?

This is the error I get with F11's Script Listener.

```
-- Error occurred in anonymous codeblock; filename: C:\Program Files\Autodesk\3ds Max 2011\Scripts\Diva.ms; position: 4085; line: 146
>> MAXScript FileIn Exception: -- Syntax error: at bad, expected <factor>

Well I've now attempted and instead I get no error but as well as no actual result imported into max. No errors appear in the script listener. When I run it, I'm allowed to choose a file and then after I open it there is a slight loading time. But then it resumes like normal with no model imported.

I'd imagine there'd be some sort of notification if it had worked properly. Oddly enough every other script I've run has always appeared in the script editor window. While this new 2011 one you provided does not.

I apologize for the inconvenience and I appreciate the time your putting in to assist me.

Anyone what the VF5 TBL format is for?
In Project Diva DT the ibl files seem to direct to the stage obj files.
Is this for stage creation and object placement perhaps?

Hi everyone and thank chrrox for the tool, Its awesome+++.

I got the Virtua FIghter 5 model into 3ds max but I don't know how to get the textures.
I try to use "Texturefinder" and got some textures out (not all the textures) and the texture I get looks distorted and do not line-up with the model UV.

I look in the darkmatter2 website, I see that "Codeman"  have texture extractor tool for vf5 calls "vf5textodds" but the link is DOWN.
I wonder if anyone have Codeman tool or if there is another way that I can extract the textures.

Help Thank.

It seems that some of the dds files are saved in ATI2N Format I can view them without any issues externaly. It just seems that 3ds max doesnt want read them even with the dds plugins provided by nvidia . I might have to try and see if i can convert them into another format somehow. They seem to be Bump map textures.

You need a jailbroken ps3 to rip ps3 games there are a million tutorials on how to do that on the internet. if you have the 360 version of vf5 you need a kreon drive in your pc or a jtaged 360. you might be able to install the files onto your 360 hard drive then copy them off onto your pc but i have not tried it that way.

Thanks for the info.

I don't really want to tamper with my PS3 in any way,

but Thanks Chroxx, You definitely are really good at what you do here and I have no doubt that you're scripts work as I have used many others before.

so I guess I'll have to miss out on this one, but I appreciate the advice regardless.

Use the farc extractor to extract the .farc files.And extract for example the "rin_tex500.gz" (you can open the .gz files with WinZip).You will get rin_tex500.bin.In the first post ,download the attachment and use the TXP.bms in quickbms to get the texture

This script import the facial expressions too?

I'm a bit new to this...

The problem I'm having is that I have all the files, except the skeletal structure, set up ready, but I don't know how to use the textures, once converted, to make Miku look right.

Does anyone have a 'crib sheet' for what texture map goes where?

Forgive me for my ignorance as I am new to 3ds Max... I've got the obj.bins and I can import the models, I was also successful in extracting the textures and now I've got a folder full of dds files. But now, how exactly do I use those dds images? When viewed from Compressonator I can recognize where these textures should go but I'm clueless as to how I can import them. I thought it would be automated but that doesn't seem to be the case.

What version of max do you use? 3dsmax 2010 and 2011 support the dds texures without problems 
(PS: have you applied correctly the textures to the model?)
Anyway if you want convert the dds in another common format like .tga you can use scarlet v2.

Hm, now that the topic has been bumped, perhaps it should noted that the script seems to leave out a number of bones from each model. Namely the root, a few spine and upper thigh bones. It's quite annoying to have to add replacement bones before manually re-applying the envelopes to the proper bones... Mainly the following bones, judging from a bone list in one of HMPD:DT's files:

```
cl_mune [Spine]
n_mune_b [Spine B]
cl_momo_l [Left thigh]
cl_momo_r [Right thigh]
n_momo_l_cd_ex [Left thigh extra]
n_momo_r_cd_ex [Right thigh extra]
```


...are among a few that don't seem to get imported. Is there a reason for that, or is the importing script missing them for some reason?

this is one of the worst coded formats in history.

So as far I've followed this topic that only Dreamy theater was used, (and vf) So has someone already took a look at DT 2nd? 
[http://dnstje.deviantart.com/art/Rin-dt2-290550784](http://dnstje.deviantart.com/art/Rin-dt2-290550784)

So far it used the same farc files, and the same extraction. too bad for me was at DT1st I couldnt extract everything what was in the farc packages, some gz's are currupted after reaching the 20th file. I took a look with a hex editor, and seems the offset is messed up. but the DT2nd extracted fine.
(succesfully copied dt2nd files from my ps3 and payed 3900￥, I could find links on the web anyway, though I need a reference.)

Question: there's something I didn't quite understand. Does the script import bones with weights too? Or only bones? Because when I tested some, the model stayed static, but maybe I'm just doing something wrong (the game I am trying to extract models from is VF5)

If im right he couldnt find the bone ID's, not sure though. I've played it with it too, but Its better to use the bone placement as a reference I think.

Yeah, I can load bones too in fact. The problem is they don't work, the models are static and this because, I think, weights are missing.

Update: I was wrong, weights are actually there.. But they are totally wrong (for example, if I move a face bone, fingers rotate). Is there a way to fix that (or is it possible to create a fixer)? I really hope so..

I really hope so..Well, there is one way. And even then it's a pain in the butt -- in 3DS Max, for example, there's a way to export the "envelopes" for a model segment and re-import it, re-assigning the original envelopes for different bones. Only problem with that, though, is that separate elements may need to be manually fixed even then (Rin's sleeve computer, for instance).

Use an older version of the script, the one that DOESN'T have support for skinning.

On that note, any update to the script yet to fix that problem?

Thank you for your script.But I still have some questions.I found that the weights of the bones are wrong.Do you know how to fix them?
  I found something interesting."H:\PS3 Dream Theatre 2\USRDIR\rom\rob".I guess that there are motion files in this folder.I use quickbms to rip the farc files in this folder.Then I get some bin files.It is only a step to get the motion file.But I don't know how to write the script to rip this kind of bin file.Can you help me?Thank you very much.  


  Sorry for my bad English.

Well, it may be too late but here it goes anyway.

I think I figure out how to relate each vertex to a bone.
In the original script (virtual5.ms), it read each Bone (Bone1, Bone2, Bone3, and Bone4), divide them by 3.0 and group that into B1_array.  Later it just use that number directly to create the mesh.

What should happen is to use some extra parameters stored at FOffset1 location.
1. Read the FCount1 amount of u16 integer stored at FOffset1 location.
2. Let's call this array as WeightIndex.  Each face group will have it's own separate WeightIndex array.
3. Take the B1_array number (still divided by 3.0), index into the WeightIndex array to get a integer.
4. The resulting integer from the WeightIndex is the actual bone index for that vertex.

Anyway, as I said, it may be too late for anyone to give a damn about this anyway.

chrrox, can you check this script and the cmat files, someone write it to auto assign texture and material for Project Diva Dream Theater 1, but I can't contact that guy now. And I want to extract models from Project Diva Dream Theater 2. So if you can figure out how to do the auto assign texture in your method, it would be great.

FYI - the script does work with Virtua Fighter Final Shodown for those looking for lots of new accessories and the few new stages/characters. (thanks a lot chrrox)

Can anyone using 3dsmax give a quick step by step on how to import the textures?  I've never used max before and have been trying this out on one of our school's computer lab that has it installed. The script loads the models/accessories but it doesn't appear to associate the dds textures (which I have in the same folder as the object file) with the materials that are registered in the scene.

(is it suppose to? or are we expected to associate each material manually?)

((if it's the latter - where can we find a list of what dds files map to which materials?))

For example:

I'm trying apply the textures to saritm000_obj2 (sarah)

There are 5 multi-sub object basic parameters for this object:
- EYEBALL (ID 1)
- EYELENS (ID 2)
- SKIN (ID 3)
- SKIN (ID 4)
- HAIR (ID 5)

Next to EYEBALL I can click 'CH_EYEBALL_SD003Z2' but I don't see any reference to which file(s) are needed for this material.

I thought somewhere on this pane I would see 'saritm000_tex_4.dds' (which is the eyeball texture) but I don't.

It's pretty easy to guess which texture the eyeball is but for some of the stages I have no clue which textures go with what materials.

Any suggestions?

Whenever i try to import a Dreamy Theater model to 3dsMax using this plugin it freezes, takes a loooooong time and then it freezes my entire computer making me have to force shut down and the model didnt get imported. Could you possibly fix it? Or is there something I have to do for it not to freeze my entire computer?

Based on chrrox's script, I've developed an import addon for Blender.

It's mostly comparable in features to the original, although it doesn't import bone weights right now.

If you're still out there chrrox, could you give me a hint (if you remember) as to where they're hiding the bones your script doesn't import? I'm pretty stumped.

Good news!

I've discovered how the material/texture/image association is done, meaning textures are assigned automatically!

As long as you've extracted them from the *_tex.bin with chrrox's TXP script to the same directory and haven't changed the basename, the script will pick them up in the following order of preference: png, tga, dds. (Blender can render images correctly with the dds textures, but it doesn't look like the realtime GLSL works with them).

I used nvdecompress from [https://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/](https://code.google.com/p/nvidia-texture-tools/) for converting these dds to tga/png, but I'm sure there are others.

Also, if you have the tex_db.bin file in the same directory as the *_obj.bin file, I can retrieve the texture names from that file.

I've also incorporated bone weights based on the information from emankcin700jp, and I set the bone parent chains for most of the jigglebones.

I've only been able to test this with PDDT 1 and 2, would be interested to see if it works for VF5 as well.

Enjoy!

Please, I only need the 3D models with textures for blender. I hope it's possible, it's been so much trying to extract him

Chrrox maxscript supports correct weighting data but applied to wrong bones.

Well I never got perfect weights with the way I did it, but the blender script from oddwarlock imports weights assigned to the correct bones, just the bones aren't parented. For some reason the weights are messed up slightly though.

The blender script's weights aren't the same to chrrox's scripts ones, his are somewhat more accurate

Hello chorrx, there's a problem with the script. Sometimes when I load some stage .bin it tries to import but it fails due to this line 
```
meditMaterials[aa] = Multimaterial()
```

I don't know why this is happening but not all stages happen to import this way. For example
stgd2pv042s02_obj imports fine while stgd2pv042s04_obj can't import because of this error.
I'm using 3DS max 2016

I've been reading all the posts on the thread and tried to follow as best I can.

I have the PS3 version of Virtua Fighter 5 and have used the posts information to get the FLAC and the BIN files. But when I try importing them into 3DS Max, it starts to import the files, but then brings a frustrating window of script errors.

I don't know if it's just me or what but I'm hoping that some of you tech guys out there can help :/

I'm a little lost to say the least. The files I'm trying to use I believe are from Jacky Bryant. Not sure what bit though as it exported two hundred or so RAR files all containing BIN (One for the OBJ.BIN and one for TEX.BIN) I selected one at complete random: jakitm134_obj.bin and jakitm134_tex.bin i'm convinced I'm doing something wrong but can't identify where :/



Any advice or assist would be awesome

I have the PS3 version of Virtua Fighter 5 and have used the posts information to get the FLAC and the BIN files. But when I try importing them into 3DS Max, it starts to import the files, but then brings a frustrating window of script errors.

I don't know if it's just me or what but I'm hoping that some of you tech guys out there can help :/

Hmm...

The script is odd as it didn't like the initial file, but thought I'd try a different file and tried it on the first two files which turn out to be his body, and his hair. The bones don't affect the model (as though they're not assigned to anything, they're more joint pointers)

The textures are a very hit and miss. It's extracted a couple absolutely fine, but around 50% of them are static just like the ones on page 1. I've tried using the texture finding program, but I cant extract them.

Anyone got any ideas?

I've been wondering what are the differences between VF5 and DT models. I got a fixed weight script from a friend(it also fixes normals)on DT models, but when I use that on VF5 model files I get the error: 

```
--No ""+"" function for undefined
```

I couldn't find the tex_db.bin file while it was present in DT games and I can't even get the texture names well XD
So has anyone been able to spot the difference between DT and VF model .bin format?

Can you ask your friend if he can share the weight fix script?

I'm releasing this and I hope someone can help. This is a script made by Szkaradek123 one year ago but I have problems importing some dreamy theater models. The script was made for blender 2.49b (like all his scripts). The meshes are not perfect but functional enough for weight transfer.



[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9PZfc1ZFM&t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kM9PZfc1ZFM&t=4s)

The file I'm having problems:

[http://www.mediafire.com/file/p49wv0bmf ... 08_obj.rar](http://www.mediafire.com/file/p49wv0bmf6yv23r/rinitm008_obj.rar)

The script also supports some VF characters.

Use any of those scrips and will work fine.

Um,okay? But I don't even how to begin with those files I've download from your shared links.So I got scripts,but I got no clue how to with I don't see any virtua fighter 5 models with files. Although I wanna Goh Hinogami among fighters. I intend to convert Goh Hinogami once with file within textures and rigged with bones to xps ( Xnalara). That,if you're ever ever familiar or heard of that program...

Sp help me out and don't leave me anything unsaid for instructions.

The closest I've got so far is using Texturefinder but there are some textures that don't quite work through that, and also any visible results look pretty odd as they are saved on BMP instead of a DDS. If anyone can please answer this, I would be very grateful!
PD: I just want to convert the textures; I don't need to get entire models, but rather stuff like the HUD and 2D elements, which is why I want something to extract the textures.

Done. In any case I'll see if I upload it in another mirror too.

So, I extracted the psarc file with Noesis and then I used the quickbms plugin to extract the farc on the "auth_3d" folder (which I assume its where the models are located). However, I only get .a3da files, and checking out on the internet those seem to be camera files, so I did not find any model files at all. Can someone help me? Where are the model files located?

I wrote a maxscript for this over on my DA page
[https://www.deviantart.com/mariokart64n ... -870539837](https://www.deviantart.com/mariokart64n/art/PS3-Virtua-FIghter-5-Mesh-Importer-870539837)

and even spent a week porting it to blender, however I have just heard through a friend that there is already a highly functional model tool that does both importing and exporting and doesnt have any issues.

Since the model file is missing bone parenting information, none of the tools here (including mine) fix that and that is because the bone parenting is in a separate file..

Well this other tool 'Miku Miku Model' gets it right reads the files from the install folder and correctly renders the model with its original bone parenting and even naming which was stored in a database file.

So just dropping this here so people don't waste there time, all the tools posted previously won't get the model complete, instead look into this tool it can even export new models and animations from what I'm told.
