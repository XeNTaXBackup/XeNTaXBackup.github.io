Thanks! I didn't tried the game yet, so I wonder did they keep the same format for all game archives? Will the old extraction tools for Shadow of Mordor 1 work on this new game?

Hi! No, game archives are a bit different, but there's awesome BMS script by aluigi (thanks a lot to him, as always) You can extract everything you may need:) I'm going to post model-import scripts tomorrow, so you'll be able to import models too.

Hi guys! Sooo, here are the scripts. Few tips:
1) Second script with "_cloth" word, apply it after using main one, bascically what you should do, import model and if there's something looks missing (cloth, cape, skirt, fabrics etc) use second "cloth" script or if .skel file is 400+kb you can bet it has "cloth" meshes inside xD 
2) With main script for rigged meshes, if any part would have "broken" uv's. Do this simple procedure:
Select the model and add the "Unwrap UVW" modifier above it and then press "Edit" button
Change the channel from 1 to 2 and press the button "Reset UVWs", when prompted, press Yes. 
This will display the second texture coordinates set. Second Uv's channel

This might sound complex, but I gave those script for few ppl and they had no big problems with them. Anyways, you could always ask or bug report anything here. Have fun!

Hi zaramot!
Did you watch another file types (.objres, .inst, .wldclnt and etc.)?
I'm interesting what in them.

Here's an update for Noesis texture plugins. Added support for .texa and .tex0 texture types (which could be unstable due to lack of samples) and improved support for .tex and .texuhd files.

nazgul_body_isildur.mesh
nazgul_body_hammerhand.mesh

I can't find them anywhere. I believe it might be corrupted script or my eyes.

Hey Zaramot,
Is it possible to convert/export a large number of game texture files at once using these scripts and neosis?

Thank you

i wish to thank you for this script, but i also would like to point out a few issues that need fixing, first of is the Balrog, its armor and wings are fine but the main body mesh's uv's are a bit messed up, some wights for cloth (mainly the Nazgul) are a bit wonkey in a few places, and Sauron's Elf-Form has completely broken weights, just a few things i felt needed pointing out for the next update

anyways have a good one

Hey! I know about some troubles with the script, mainly with cloth, I can't fix it unfortunatelly (like robes of Sauron's fair form, it's cloth physics meshes). As for Balrog, his uv's I can fix them, just need his model. Also, does anyone have models of new nazgul from DLC "The Blade of Galadriel "? If anyone could get it or got already, please send me a PM. Thanks!

Here's how they look like

Hello my friend,
I think I have a little problem. I think the "Shadow_of_War_cloth.ms" script does not work well enough.  Because they have bone & weight errors in the models I import. 
I do not know if I ever told you about it before. So nowhere in the up-to-date SOW script.

I am stupid, I have not read the your   writings.

This might sound complex, but I gave those script for few ppl and they had no big problems with them. Anyways, you could always ask or bug report anything here. Have fun!I HATE to ask dumb questions about stuff that has already been explained, because I feel that's all I do on here.
However, I just can't make this work for some reason.
Apologies.

I have a few models with [what I, at least, would categorize as] "broken" uv's.
I can Unwrap UVW just fine (I think), however, I can't see any "Edit" button after doing so...
The only "channel" I can seem to find and manipulate is the map channel, which I can set to 2 (getting a prompt that asks me if I want to move the UV to this channel or abandon it), but nothing changes if I do. Pressing the "Reset UVWs" after this changes nothing either.
If I change the channel back to 1, I seem to get NEW broken uv's, which is a result (I guess), but pressing the "Reset UVWs" revets to my original [and also broken] uv's.
I have tinkered with this for a few hours now and feel only dumber. I have started over from scratch many times, and read your instructions closely everytime. I don't know what to keep trying...
I am using Autodesk 3DS Max 2018, if that makes any difference to you.

I have uploaded one of the models giving me trouble (and its corresponding texture).

Thank for your work so far Zaramot.

EDIT:
I cannot seem to upload files, for whatever reason.
You can download from my dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ku5ilk6sdrzzeqw/ancientorcsword.rar?dl=0).

I do not know what to say.Judging by your screenshot, it looks like we're manipulating the same setting with the same result.
Is it possible that the model files have been altered somehow since the script was made?

If that is the case, then now that the definitive edition is out, an absolute script is possible, since the chance of the files being altered now should be very low...

Thank you for taking the time to show me that I'm not a complete moron...

speaking of UV's being messed (I mentioned this to Zaramot before) the Balrog's body UV's are messed up, though his armor isn't which is good

also if anyone knows i'd like to ask where Isildur, Hammerhand, and Sulidan's models are located, as i can only find the textures, same for the Drake as well

and... does anyone know if Shelob's Spider, and Fairform are even in the game files?

well, thats unfortunate, still aside from the Nazgul and Drakes i cannot seem to locate many of the Uruk and Olog armors and some meshes (especially the Tower Uruk)

though i feel thats because of the bms script... idk if thats been updated lately but thats why some things are more difficult to locate than others (though thats just a guess)

hmm, now that i think about it, shelob herself was in pre-rendered cutscenes using the game engine, so odds are she isn't in the files (either of her forms for that matter)
so that's unfortunate... very unfortunate

so what about the drakes, because i've only found the head and wing webbing, as well as textures, not the whole model (idk why it's so illusive)

I don't think I'il find the other one.This, I believe, would be the model of the spider that appears above the floating shards when collecting Shelob memories.
As Shelob, regardless of shape, only appears in pre-rendered cut-scenes, it would surprise me if a model of her was found in the gamefiles (she could be in there somewhere as cut content, stranger things have happened, but I wouldn't bet on it).
How good would a Shelob boss-fight have been, though?

As far as I know there is no fellbeast in the game, my best guess being that this was repurposed and remodelled early in developement, but never renamed.
If you're missing anything else, I can try my eyes at finding it. Even though I'm still having trouble with the UV's of some models, I have yet to find a model in the game I cannot locate in the files...

On the subject of my busted UVs;
Would anyone be willing to pull the example file above (model located in \prefabs\artifacts\ancorcsword, textures located in \prefabs\artifacts\materials) out of their game archives, and see if they encounter the same issue, or if they are able to correct the UVs (by manipulating the map channel setting), as Zaramot has detailed?
This would tell me if the issue is indeed the script, or if something has gone wrong in the unpacking of my game archives.
I would perform this test myself, but I fear my data would be of little use, extracting the same files from the same archives using the same technique.

Btw, Zaramot, did anyone ever send you those Naz’gul you were looking for?
If not, I think I might be able to find them.

i guess i must be looking in the wrong embb files, but it's a shame the UVs are messed up

speaking of embb files, what are the ones that hold all the Nazgul, and Uruk/Olog armors called, as i can't find those either

no need to send the files, i just wanna know where they are located

Way easier than looking through the game's .embb files is just unpacking the whole lot and searching. That way you can find whatever you want.

I have unpacked the entire game, so I can give you the directories of what you want, but not the .embb files containing them.
If it's a space issue (which is the only reason I can fathom for doing things the way I understand you to be doing them), external harddrives are like way cheap nowadays, yo!

The Nazgûl are located in \characters\modelcharacters\nazgul and their weapons should be located in \characters\modelweapons\nazgul
The Nazgûl HD textures are located in a folder simpy called \nazgul in your export directory.

As for orc and olog armor, what I could find was in the folders \characters\modelcharacters\orcs and \characters\modelcharacters\ologhai (special armor will be located in the subfolder of each of these called 'flair')
The HD textures for orc/olog armor are scattered all over your main directory...

If you need anything specific that you cannot find in these folders, let me know and I'll take another look.
Just to illustrate my point with exporting into one directory, finding this stuff took me literally 5 minutes, just searching 'nazgul' and 'armor'.

I have unpacked the entire game, so I can give you the directories of what you want, but not the .embb files containing them.
If it's a space issue (which is the only reason I can fathom for doing things the way I understand you to be doing them), external harddrives are like way cheap nowadays, yo!

After you export the archives of the game, you must re-export the newly created files.

You can export all of your embb files again. But do not export these "photomode.embb, balrog.embb" files.

> Hey! I know about some troubles with the script, mainly with cloth, I can't fix it unfortunatelly (like robes of Sauron's fair form, it's cloth physics meshes). As for Balrog, his uv's I can fix them, just need his model. Also, does anyone have models of new nazgul from DLC "The Blade of Galadriel "? If anyone could get it or got already, please send me a PM. Thanks!

Here's how they look like

here the all the files for the balrog, the UV is really messed up

Sorry for the bump

A request was made through the xentax discord to have [zaramot's maxscript](https://forum.xentax.com/viewtopic.php?t=17200#p134798) converted to a noesis plugin.
I have gone through zaramot's maxscript line for line and convert it comparably to python, the attached script below will work with [Noesis](https://richwhitehouse.com/index.php?content=inc_projects.php&showproject=91)



 fmt_shadowofwar_mesh.zip
Noesis Python Plugin for PC version of Middle-earth: Shadow of War (3.39 KiB) Downloaded 257 times



*The script only views meshes, UV's and texture loading was not incorporated in this python script. of course any previous issues with the maxscript are inherited such as it not working with certain files or models. I would have looked into it, but I only had access to the spider sample posted here

A small addition to the Zaramot's script
Changed the logic for processing UW coordinates.
Now the script always creates 2 channels and sometimes changes their order.

If you mean levels-buildings and props (most of them), then nooo they are using another format and need another script. I know this, because long time ago I was building Minas Morgul in fallout 4 using models from SoW

Hey Zaramot,

I have found another slight problem. erik945’s script worked a treat for extracting everything that had messed up uv’s that I could not fix with the proposed method, and almost everything comes out correctly now using one script or the other.
However, I have found a few models that I simply can’t get out.

Eltariels DLC armor does not seem to extract correctly using the clothing script, which I have never had an issue with until now. The four files (blade armor 1 and 2, and woodelf armor 1 and 2) ectract the armor fine, but the clothes (the skirt bit), which I am fairly certain is contained in the same files, won’t extract. Some of the files even give me an error.
The clothing of the cloaks in the same DLC all extract correctly.
Is this something you’d be willing to take a look at, Zaramot?

I cannot attach the files, but they can be snagged from my dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/y1bl2b8qlxobbt7/Eltariel%20armor.rar?dl=0). Should be safe.
Those are all the files giving me problems, as well as their textures, and some duplicates from the game files that may behave differently.

Just out of curiosity, why are the script and clothing script separate?
The scripts are run on the same files, and extract different things. Why are they not just one script?
Is it to save time, because one of them does a lot of unnecessary stuff?
Again, not telling anyone how to do their work, because frankly I have no business doing so.
Just asking a question because I have been working with these particular scripts a lot lately

I have found a few more cases of what I reported above in Talions gear.
With all tiers of the Rhovanion and Ranger armor sets, the cloth will extract, but omit certain parts.

Furthermore, I have found a few models which give me errors when using the cloth script; player_blacknumt3_armor, player_numenoreant1_armor, player_haradrimt1_cloak, player_haradrimt2_cloak, player_rangert2_cloak.
Nothing is extracted from these files, they just give an error.

I have put all the models that give me problems in an archive which you can grab from my dropbox [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/i6bbqhh5a0o5r0y/Talion%20armor.rar?dl=0).
Thank you for all your work!

How did you get the static meshes to make Minas Morgul?  I am trying with Ninja Ripper but it does not rip anything when using D3D11 Wrapper and the game executable won't start if I use the Intruder Inject

I made maxscript for .inst files (it's maps, buildings etc), still it was a hard task since models aren't placed correctly, there are some other files with such info, I guess but I haven't dig into it THAT much.

Is this of any use without at least cloth script and UV map? I guess it is, but at elast those two things should be added. This is good beginning as it is.

Hello! I am brand new to this whole model swapping deal and don't really know where to start. I have wanted to mess around with model swapping for mostly only the characters in game since it came out, but never really knew where to begin. Could any of you fine fellows point me in the right direction, preferably something user friendly lol. Thank you!

I suppose that you start with mastering unpacking and re-packing the archives.
I use QuickBMS to extract from archives and then again to get game files. You can use script for shadow of mordor in this program, it works on SOW too. (although not sure about repacking them)
That way you can get the models and possibly make repacks too, the program is easy to use.
Once you have the files, I guess that you can start making switching and repack, although the process won't be that simple I fear.
BTW do you have 3DS Max? I would use a little help myself with usage of the SoW script import. (PM me)

I've spend a lot of time digging through the files, corecharacter, hotchunk, monsters and all around them, missing weapons and few missing textures I was looking for...
I completely missed the file UI_assets, that contains them. Have you checked that one? It evaded my eyes for long. Might contain what you need.

My primary issue is now whether I should rewrite the importing scripts for Blender or not. But that would be cool I guess.

I did not check the files. I will not do that right now.
But I think these are the models you are looking for. --> [https://www.mediafire.com/file/8v76tjbi ... il.7z/file](https://www.mediafire.com/file/8v76tjbi51oxcp0/Idril.7z/file)
You check. You report your result.

Hello, I would like to extract the Shadow of War models and textures, preferably with rigs, for studying purposes, but I am having trouble figuring out how to do so. I am not sure what to do with the attached files, as there is no mention. I have quickbms but not sure if something else is also required. I'd really appreciate some help, I've never done this before but I would like to learn. I haven't been able to find anything else on this subject but this thread here on the forum.
